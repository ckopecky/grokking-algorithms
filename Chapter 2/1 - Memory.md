# How memory works

Imagine you go to a show and you need to check your things. A chest of drawers is available for that purpose. Each drawer can hold one element. 
 - You ask for two drawers, each drawer will hold one element each. 

You store your things here and you're ready to go! 

This is basically, at a high-level, how a computer's memory works. Your computer looks like a giant chest of drawers, and each drawer has an address. 

What if you want to store multiple things in one drawer? 

 - arrays and linked lists come into play here.
