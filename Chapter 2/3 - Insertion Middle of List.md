### Inserting into the middle of a list

Suppose you want your todo list to work more like a calendar. Earlier, we were adding things to the end of a list. 

Now you want to add them in the order in which they should be done. 

What is better if you want to insert elements in the middle: arrays or lists? 

With lists, it's as easy as changing what the previous element points to. 

But for arrays, you have to shift all the rest of the elements in order to make room for the new element. If there is no space, you might have to copy everything to a new location! 

__Lists__ are better if you want to insert stuff into the middle.
