Pseudocode for selection sort:
Write a function to find the smallest element:

def findSmallest(arr):
    
1. start smallest value at at the first index of the array. `smallest = arr[0]`
2. set the smallest_index var to `0`.
3. Write a for loop that will find the smallest and assign it to smallest and smallest_index.
4. return the smallest_index.

5. Now let's tackle selection sort. 

def Selection_Sort(arr):

1. declare a new array into var `arr`. 
2. Write a for loop that will find the smallest using the function created above. 
3. append that that result to the new array. 
4. return the new array.
